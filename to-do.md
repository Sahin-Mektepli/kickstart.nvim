-I dont like how the autocomplete works right now. If I don't get used to using C-Y to complete, I will default back to CR
-Linting does not fully work I guess. It should warn me about having "headers" for python files like coc.nvim does
  -It also does not show the functions returns and variable types as coc did...
-split windows work a bit weird right now: It's either about iterm or nvim (and this didn't happen with vim) but I cannot return to the other window from the terminal window, eventhough I can traverse the other way around...
